This basic initiation to natural language processing (and mining of linguistic data) covers the following points :

1. NB (JB) : Linguistics/NLP for dummies 
From sound to meaning, basic terms and available linguistic programs
-> outline the project and the learning curve  
 Describe available tools for automatic analysis of linguistic data
  [Phonetic conversion (and text to speech)](https://tophonetics.com/)
  [French parsing on line](http://5.135.166.30/send2UDPIPE.html)
  [English parsing, Part-of-speech tagging, Stanford's suite of tools:](http://corenlp.run/)


Assignment : with your classmate : install ANACONDA, pip, python,


2. JB (NB):  python for dummies 
Basic notions (loops) and commands to understand python 

Assignment : with your classmate : install the CMU library, install Latex (create your own overleaf account)  


3. NB : The art of writing a conference abstract, finding references on Google Scholar, storing them with Zotero/Mendeley in Bibtex format.

 Assignment: create an overleaf abstract, search models for abstracts for conferences. 

4. JB : Using Latex and templates for papers : the architecture of a scientific paper (stylesheet as textual structure)
LAteX for posters and presentations, etc.

5. NB (JB): : case study 1.  the Carnagie Mellon university phonetic dictionary :  the basics of morphophonology : main concepts, open access databases
Assignment : recode with IPA symbols, a few regex scripts for data wrangling 


6 JB (NB) the CMU dictionary and related python libraries
[library pronouncing :](https://pronouncing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html)
data cleaning  and data wrangling on the CMU (regex) : setting up your own github and post your first scripts


7. NB (JB) Creating a dataset : out of the CMU dictionary: 
ML: predicting a class (final consonant and initial consonant)
INSTRUCTIONS (to be continued)
1. split the words into syllables
2. use the syllable as the last column.
3. extract last consonant



8. JB:  writing your first Jupyter notebook
Asignment : submitting your abstract / read existing notebooks on 18th century dictionaries


7. NB: Walker dictionary : suffix extraction and the Linguistica tool and library
[Examples with Buchanan's dictionary:](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/gitlab.huma-num.fr/mshs-poitiers/forellis/dicodiachro/raw/master/Buchanan_eng.ipynb?flush_cache=true)
[Comparison between Buchanan and Walker:](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/gitlab.huma-num.fr/mshs-poitiers/forellis/dicodiachro/raw/master/Buchanan-Walker_Exploration-Syneresis.ipynb?flush_cache=true)

Assignment: read the Goldsmisth et al. paper 
Install the [linguistica library](https://pypi.org/project/linguistica/)

8. JB:  Python library linguistica
http://linguistica-uchicago.github.io/lxa5/
data : case study 2: the Brown corpus and the Linguistica library (Goldsmith 2015) : the unsupervised learning of morphological stems and inflectional paradigms

9. NB : Computational approaches to linguistics: Lu 2014  (Treetagger and PoS-tagging) low level annotation : Pos-tagging 
Assignment : do Part of speech annotation for 18th century dictionaries 

10:  JB the spaCy library: parsing data 
[SpaCy](https://spacy.io/)

11. NB: Using Spacy annotation to isolate zero relatives 
Estimate precision and recall of a script for a given linguistic structure: 
[script](https://github.com/kimgerdes/SUD/blob/master/tools/searchRelatives.py)

12. Designing a poster (overleaf)
January : poster session at Descartes


Second semester 
Scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python (Pedregosa et al. 2011): the basics
Motivated students will sumbit a collective paper.
