**5. Selected projects and references (A brief description of the projects and stepping stones to the projects)  PROVISIONAL**

TODO Write the project in details, List the research questions and plan the data processing


ALL: collect BibTex references in a .BIB file, begin writing the abstract/ poster sections. 
(define keywords, abstract, RQ, SOA, training data, results, future research)


**1. Text generation with phonological constraints (Rap Machine)** <br/>
(Eitanite, Hind, Nelson) <br/>
(phonological, rhythmic pattern, text generation)


INSTRUCTIONS:
The pronouncing package and its youtube tutorial: generate poems with the pronouncing library / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0pdPNh86H0
1 hour youtube video for reverse engineering : find how the functions do what they do
extend functions from the demo
pr.rhymes("failings")
pr.rhyming_part(pr.phones)
logical values and test : do these words rhyme?


INSTRUCTIONS :  investigate the Carnegie Mellon university phonetic dictionary <br/>
http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict <br/>
Look at stress patterns for words (and stress notation: 2, 1, 0) <br/>
Generate Heptasyllabic poems <br/>
Search for text-generation githubs, detail corpora (2pac?), detail the patterns generated

ASSIGNMENT : in class,  present the CMU dictionary as a resource and the corresponding library (CMU, pronouncing).


**2. Two Projects in morphology investigating 18th century dictionaries**  <br/>
(Blanche, Dao , Fran√ßois, Preethi): 2 projects for 4 students <br/>

RQ1 : Can we use TreeTagger to analyse Buchanan and Walker : can we predict the words that have become obsolete?
Run Treetagger on Walker's data.

Did Walker define all the words he used in his dictionary?

RQ2 : Can we train Treetagger with 18th century data ?
Can Treetagger learn Walker's grammatical categories (ie "s." for substantives, both NN1 and NNS) 

INSTRUCTIONS: get the data and install Treetagger. Done
Extract pos, entries and definitions (senses) from Walker's dictionary.
Use Treetagger in learning mode . Find a lexicon for Treetagger. 

ASSIGNMENT : in class,  present the Penn Treebank as a tasget and Treetagger as a tool.

Next stage: use Linguistica to analyse Walker's corpus of definitions


**3. Project in text generation (literary creation of a text to be specified)**
(Claude, Guillaume)

INSTRUCTIONS : Read papers, Specify the size of text generated (chapter? epilogue) and your research question. Specify the raining data and the features that have been used to generate the text.


**4. A Pragmatic Approach to chatbots (Making sense with a chatbot?)**  <br/>
(Emma, Sawssen)

INSTRUCTIONS: Install the Eliza python (github), discuss the limitations
Investigate the Alice (AIML) robot, Sofia and other robots.
RQ: investigate the semantic and pragmatic aspects of the interaction with the chatbot.
