This basic initiation to natural language processing (and mining of linguistic data) covers the following points :


1. NB (JB) : Linguistics/NLP for dummies 
From sound to meaning, basic terms and available linguistic programs
-> outline the project and the learning curve  

Assignment : with your classmate : install ANACONDA, pip, python,


2. JB (NB):  python for dummies 

Assignment : with your classmate : install the CMU library, install Latex (create your own overleaf account)  

3. NB : The art of writing a conference abstract, finding references on Google Scholar, storing them with Zotero/Mendeley in Bibtex format.


4. JB : Using Latex and templates for papers : the architecture of a scientific paper (stylesheet as textual structure)
LAteX for posters and presentations, etc.

5. NB (JB): : case study 1.  the Carnagie Mellon university phonetic dictionary :  the basics of morphophonology : main concepts, open access databases
Assignment : recode with IPA symbols, a few regex scripts for data wrangling 

6 JB (NB) the CMU dictionary and related python libraries
library pronouncing : https://pronouncing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html
data cleaning  and data wrangling on the CMU (regex) : setting up your own github and post your fisrt scripts

7. NB (JB) Creating a dataset : out of the CMU dictionary: 
ML: predicting a class (final consonant and initial consonant)
INSRUCTIONS (to be continued)
1. split the words into syllables
2. use the syllable as the last column.
3. extract last consonant

8. JB:  writing your first Jupyter notebook
Asignment : submitting your abstract / read existing notebooks on 

7. NB: Walker dictionary : suffix extraction and the Linguistica tool and library

7.  Computational approaches to linguistics: Lu 2014  (Treetagger and PoS-tagging)

8.  python library :
9.  data : case study 2: the Brown corpus and the Linguistica library (Goldsmith 2015) : the unsupervised learning of morphological stems and inflectional paradigms
10. Designing a poster (overleaf) 
11. parsing data : the spaCy library


12. Scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python (Pedregosa et al. 2011): the basics
