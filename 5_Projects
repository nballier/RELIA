5. Selected projects and references (A brief description of the projects and stepping stones to the projects)  PROVISIONAL
TODO Write the project in details, List the research questions and plan the data processing


2 projects in Phonetics / phonology about syllable structures, based on the analysis of the CMU dictionary library (pronouncing) 

more advanced : compare syllable counts in the Pychant/pyphen libraries and the pronouncing 



2 projects in morphology investigating 18th century dictionaries 
- using NLTK / Linguistica : can we compare the differences in suffixation with modern dictionaries?
- using TreeTagger to analyse Buchanan and Walker : can we predict the words that have become obsolete?


*Several projects in grammar investigating the annotation of "that" and the relative versus noun complement clause distinction* 

- Wordnet : using the NLTK wordnet resources, can we predict the nouns that would have the same properties as nouns governing noun complement clauses (submission, assumption, fact) 

- Can Treetagger learn how to tag 'that' for relative clauses / noun complement clauses ?

- can we teach NLTK how to tag 'that' for relative clauses / noun complement clauses ?

- can we teach NLTK how to tag 'that' when adverbial  (it's not that difficult)

- using the spaCy library, can we retrieve noun complement clauses  with a script ?
