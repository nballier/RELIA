This basic initiation to natural language processing covers the following points :


1. The art of writing a conference abstract, finding references on Google Scholar, storing them with Zotero and Bibtex.
2. Using Latex and templates for papers : the architecture of a scientific paper
3. data : case study 1.  the Carnagie Mellon university phonetic dictionary :  the basics of morphophonology : main concepts, open access databases
4. data cleaning  and data wrangling on the CMU (regex) : setting up your own github
5. python library  1: writing your first Jupyter notebook
6. mid-term submission : submitting your abstract
7.  Computational approaches to linguistics: Lu 2014  (Treetagger and PoS-tagging)
8.  python library2 : manda / panda
9.  data : case study 2: the Brown corpus and the Linguistica library (Goldsmith 2015) : the unsupervised learning of morphological stems and inflectional paradigms
10. Designing a poster (overleaf) 
11. parsing data : the spaCy library


12. Scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python (Pedregosa et al. 2011)
