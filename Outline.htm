This basic initiation to natural language processing (and mining of linguistic data) covers the following points :


1. NB : The art of writing a conference abstract, finding references on Google Scholar, storing them with Zotero/Mendeley in Bibtex format.

Assignment : with your classmate : install ANACONDA, pip, python, and the CMU library, install Latex (create your own overleaf account)  

2. JB : Using Latex and templates for papers : the architecture of a scientific paper (stylesheet as textual structure)
LAteX for posters and presentations, etc.

3. NB: : case study 1.  the Carnagie Mellon university phonetic dictionary :  the basics of morphophonology : main concepts, open access databases
Assignment : recode with IPA symbols, a few regex scripts for data wrangling 

4. JB (+NB) : data cleaning  and data wrangling on the CMU (regex) : setting up your own github
Creating a dataset : out of the CMU dictionary
1. split the words into syllables
2. use the syllable as the last column.
3. extract last consonant

5. python library  1: writing your first Jupyter notebook

6. mid-term submission : submitting your abstract
7.  Computational approaches to linguistics: Lu 2014  (Treetagger and PoS-tagging)
8.  python library2 : manda / panda
9.  data : case study 2: the Brown corpus and the Linguistica library (Goldsmith 2015) : the unsupervised learning of morphological stems and inflectional paradigms
10. Designing a poster (overleaf) 
11. parsing data : the spaCy library

12. Scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python (Pedregosa et al. 2011): the basics
