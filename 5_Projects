TODO Write the project in details, List the research questions and plan the data processing


2 projects in Phonetics / phonology about syllable structures, based on the analysis of the CMU dictionary library (pronouncing) 
  - exploitation du dictionnary CMU (libre) (extraction de donn√©es contextuelle syllabiques)
  - autre dictionnaire le CELEX (sous licence)

more advanced : compare syllable counts in the Pychant/pyphen libraries and the pronouncing

the "phoneme set" is based on ARPABET, see the CMUPhonemeSet.txt file for conversions.

The data with syllables http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~kondrak/cmudict/cmudict.rep
is based on the CELEX syllable boundaries (not a good idea-NB) as explained in Bartlett et al. 2009.

2 projects in morphology investigating 18th century dictionaries 

- using NLTK / Linguistica : can we compare the differences in suffixation with modern dictionaries?
- using TreeTagger to analyse Buchanan and Walker : can we predict the words that have become obsolete?




*Several projects in grammar investigating the annotation of "that" and the relative versus noun complement clause distinction* 

- Wordnet : using the NLTK wordnet resources, can we predict the nouns that would have the same properties as nouns governing noun complement clauses (submission, assumption, fact) 

- Can Treetagger learn how to tag 'that' for relative clauses / noun complement clauses ?

- can we teach NLTK how to tag 'that' for relative clauses / noun complement clauses ?

- can we teach NLTK how to tag 'that' when adverbial  (it's not that difficult)

- using the spaCy library, can we retrieve noun complement clauses  with a script ?


To find out about relative clauses vs. noun complement clauses, see page 4 of this paper:
